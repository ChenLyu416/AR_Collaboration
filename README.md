# AR_Collaboration

##  Introduction
This research was to investigate the viable and high-efficient multiple-users collaborating methods under the AR environment. 

The first version of it, which was completed by myself, suggested 3 interacting methods with 2 different extra auxiliary means. Scientific control was used when designing the experiments to compare those means. The experiment data was collected and analysed after the experiments. In the end, there is supposed to be a relative research paper accomplished upon the results.

## About the code 
This repository is the implementation of the version 1 experiment which allows multiple users to interact with some artificially imposed constraints using the internet. There are 7 experiment scenes built in total.

The AR environment was developed using the Unity game engine and Meta AR headset.
